# UART demonstration files

These files have been taken from the
[wbuart](https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbuart32) repository, and modified for the
ICO board.

To run them, you will need a
[PModUSBUART](https://store.digilentinc.com/pmod-usbuart-usb-to-uart-interface)
or other external UART port.  You'll also need to plug the UART into the right
PMod port.
